Methods to use with your java telegram bot 


Please note that anything with "rf." before an ABS method is the instantiated class of what i have set extending the PollingBot and onUpdateReceived. Say yours is Bot.java. Just put in your main class that doesn't use abstract "onUpdateReceived" with 
     "static Bot rf = new Bot();"
and you will be good to go.
